I am a senior data scientist specializing in healthcare at NTT DATA in Barcelona. I developed predictive analytics modules for a [clinical trials platform](https://es.nttdata.com/newsfolder/ntt-data-facilita-la-puesta-en-marcha-de-innovatrial). Additionally, I have implemented a [machine learning-powered dashboard to help social care workers anticipate institucionalization in elderly individuals](https://socinfodigital.es/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/20230116_DocumentoBiok_Premios_SoCinfo-1OK.pdf). I also participated in the [SmartNation AI Hackathon in Belgium](https://www.lespecialiste.be/fr/actualites/e-health/smartnation-ai-hackathon-place-aux-solutions-pour-la-sante.html), focusing on structuring free-text clinical data using large language models.

My journey into data science began in an unconventional way. Initially studying to become a pharmacist, my curiosity steered me toward [structural bioinformatics](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0162143), [statistics, and software development](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/zebu/vignettes/zebu.html). This shift ultimately led me to pursue a [Ph.D. in bioinformatics](http://hdl.handle.net/10803/674113). Throughout my doctoral work, I explored the impact of aging on the transcriptome of _Caenorhabditis elegans_, employing various techniques such as graph analysis, bayesian time-series modeling, machine learning, and generalized linear models.

During my career, I also applied machine learning to predict adverse chemotherapy responses utilizing genetic markers, performed [kinetic metabolic modeling](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpara.2024.03.005), and carried out [pharmacokinetics simulations](https://doi.org/10.1111/fcp.12156).

Aside from my professional pursuits, I have a passion for languages. I am fluent in French, Portuguese, English, Spanish, and Catalan, and can also hold a conversation in [Occitan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occitan_language) and Russian.

### Software

- [`zebu`](https://github.com/omfmartin/zebu): R package for estimating local association measures like chi-squared residuals, Lewontin’s D, pointwise mutual information, and Ducher’s Z. It also incorporates permutation tests for statistical significance assessment coded in C++. Available on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/zebu/index.html) with a detailed [usage vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/zebu/vignettes/zebu.html).

- [`trobalècte`](https://github.com/omfmartin/trobalecte): Currently developing an algorithm in Python for detecting Occitan dialects from  text samples using NLP.

- [`isotela`](https://github.com/omfmartin/isotela): R package for normalizing and differentially analyzing single-individual RNA-seq data while accounting for tissue size differences. Requires spike-ins.

- [`poete-mécanique`](https://github.com/omfmartin/poete-mecanique): Reads a random poem aloud when the Raspberry Pi motion sensor detects movement.
