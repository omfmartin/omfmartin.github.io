I am a Data Scientist at [Edpuzzle](https://edpuzzle.com/), a company that creates interactive learning tools to help educators transform any video into a lesson.

My journey into data science began in an unconventional way. Initially studying to become a pharmacist, my curiosity led me towards [structural bioinformatics](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0162143), [statistics, and software development](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/zebu/vignettes/zebu.html). This interest ultimately led me to pursue a [Ph.D. in bioinformatics](http://hdl.handle.net/10803/674113). During my doctoral work, I explored the [impact of aging on gene expression](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2024.05.050), employing techniques such as graph analysis, Bayesian time-series modeling, machine learning, and generalized linear models.

After my Ph.D., I joined NTT DATA in Barcelona as a Data Scientist focused on healthcare applications. There, I worked on [predicting chronic kidney disease progression](https://www.lne.es/asturias/2025/05/22/cuelebre-gran-almacen-datos-sanitarios-117679429.html), building predictive analytics modules for a [clinical trials platform](https://es.nttdata.com/newsfolder/ntt-data-facilita-la-puesta-en-marcha-de-innovatrial), and helping [anticipate institutionalization in elderly individuals](https://socinfodigital.es/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/20230116_DocumentoBiok_Premios_SoCinfo-1OK.pdf).

In addition, I’ve applied machine learning to predict adverse chemotherapy responses using genetic markers, conducted [kinetic metabolic modeling](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpara.2024.03.005), and performed [pharmacokinetics simulations](https://doi.org/10.1111/fcp.12156).

In addition to my professional work, I have a passion for languages. I am fluent in French, Portuguese, English, Spanish, and Catalan, and can also hold conversations in [Occitan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occitan_language) and Russian.

- [`zebu`](https://github.com/omfmartin/zebu): R package for estimating local association measures like chi-squared residuals, Lewontin’s D, pointwise mutual information, and Ducher’s Z. It also incorporates permutation tests for statistical significance assessment coded in C++. Available on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/zebu/index.html) with a detailed [usage vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/zebu/vignettes/zebu.html).

- [`trobalècte`](https://github.com/omfmartin/trobalecte): Currently developing an algorithm in Python for detecting Occitan dialects from  text samples using NLP.

- [`isotela`](https://github.com/omfmartin/isotela): R package for normalizing and differentially analyzing single-individual RNA-seq data while accounting for tissue size differences. Requires spike-ins.

- [`wpbd`](https://github.com/omfmartin/wpbd): Transforms Wiktionary data into a PocketBook compatible dictionnary.
