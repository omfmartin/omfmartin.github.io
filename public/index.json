[{"content":" I am a Data Scientist at Edpuzzle, a company that creates interactive learning tools to help educators transform any video into a lesson.\nMy journey into data science began in an unconventional way. Initially studying to become a pharmacist, my curiosity led me towards structural bioinformatics, statistics, and software development. This interest ultimately led me to pursue a Ph.D. in bioinformatics. During my doctoral work, I explored the impact of aging on gene expression, employing techniques such as graph analysis, Bayesian time-series modeling, machine learning, and generalized linear models.\nAfter my Ph.D., I joined NTT DATA in Barcelona as a Data Scientist focused on healthcare applications. There, I worked on predicting chronic kidney disease progression, building predictive analytics modules for a clinical trials platform, and helping anticipate institutionalization in elderly individuals.\nIn addition, I’ve applied machine learning to predict adverse chemotherapy responses using genetic markers, conducted kinetic metabolic modeling, and performed pharmacokinetics simulations.\nIn addition to my professional work, I have a passion for languages. I am fluent in French, Portuguese, English, Spanish, and Catalan, and can also hold conversations in Occitan and Russian.\nSoftware zebu: R package for estimating local association measures like chi-squared residuals, Lewontin’s D, pointwise mutual information, and Ducher’s Z. It also incorporates permutation tests for statistical significance assessment coded in C++. Available on CRAN with a detailed usage vignette.\ntrobalècte: Currently developing an algorithm in Python for detecting Occitan dialects from text samples using NLP.\nisotela: R package for normalizing and differentially analyzing single-individual RNA-seq data while accounting for tissue size differences. Requires spike-ins.\nwpbd: Transforms Wiktionary data into a PocketBook compatible dictionnary.\npoète-mécanique: Reads a random poem aloud when the Raspberry Pi motion sensor detects movement.\nPeer-reviewed Publications Similarities and differences in the gene expression signatures of physiological age versus future lifespan.
