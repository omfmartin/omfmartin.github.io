      <description>I am a Data Scientist at Edpuzzle, a company that creates interactive learning tools to help educators transform any video into a lesson.
My journey into data science began in an unconventional way. Initially studying to become a pharmacist, my curiosity led me towards structural bioinformatics, statistics, and software development. This interest ultimately led me to pursue a Ph.D. in bioinformatics. During my doctoral work, I explored the impact of aging on gene expression, employing techniques such as graph analysis, Bayesian time-series modeling, machine learning, and generalized linear models.</description>
